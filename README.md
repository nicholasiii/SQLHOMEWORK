# SQLHOMEWORK

This was a fairly simple homework. The database was six tables that were already second level independent, and the tables were solid, so I simply picked the keys to use for the schema. Then the QuickDB tool created all the proper commands to create the schema, and importing the CSVs was relatively simple. After that it was simply a matter of playing with SQL until I got the right queries to get the results I needed. For some of the queries I created a view that would be useful in later exercises.

The bonus was also fairly simple. The hardest part was figuring out the username/password combo (that took days), I simply shot the data to a Panda and plotted it in a bar chart.
