# SQLHOMEWORK

This was a fairly simple homework. The database was six tables that were already second level independent, and the tables were solid, so I simply picked the keys to use for the schema. Then the QuickDB tool created all the proper commands to create the schema, and importing the CSVs was relatively simple. After that it was simply a matter of playing with SQL until I got the right queries to get the results I needed. For some of the queries I created a view that would be useful in later exercises.

The bonus was significantly more problematic. The password I use to access PGPAdmin 4 was not working, so I just used the CSVs with Panda dataframes, Matplotlib, and Numpy. I got the results that were required that way.
